# Discovering youth literature in Lithuania through web scraping

For my work I had to analyse the trends in children's literature in Lithuania. As I was also interested in learning more about web scraping 
I decided to use this tool to get some key figures about this sector. This was especially necessary as I could not find any clear data on children's 
literature in Lithuania.

I used beautiful soup and selenium libraries.
